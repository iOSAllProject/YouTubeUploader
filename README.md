Based on [yt-direct-lite-ios](https://github.com/youtube/yt-direct-lite-iOS).
The yt-direct-lite-ios project has not been updated for more than two years.Although the code work well for new xcode,but The code itself is out of date.
So I prefer to rewrite part of the code.
##Modify:
- Remove  [Google APIs Client Library for Objective-C](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client/) svn dependency. Direct copy & paste some party of source code.
- Using storyboard instead of create UI element in code.
- Modify party of code in Modern Objective C.
